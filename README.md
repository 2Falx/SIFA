## Installation
* Install TensorFlow 1.10 and CUDA 9.0
* Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/cchen-cc/SIFA
cd SIFA
```

## Data Preparation
* Raw data needs to be written into `tfrecord` format to be decoded by `./data_loader.py`. The pre-processed data has been released from [PnP-AdaNet](https://github.com/carrenD/Medical-Cross-Modality-Domain-Adaptation). 
* Put `tfrecord` data of two domains into corresponding folders under `./data` accordingly.
* Run `./create_datalist.py` to generate the datalists containing the path of each data.

## Train
* Modify paramter values in `./config_param.json`
* Run `./main.py` to start the training process

## Evaluate
* Specify the model path and test file path in `./evaluate.py`
* Run `./evaluate.py` to start the evaluation.
